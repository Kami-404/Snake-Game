## Projet

It's a snake game that everyone knows. I decided to create this because it's one of the first games I played as a child, and I decided to share it. 

For the moment this is the first version, there will probably be future versions with improved graphics, functionality...

The principle is simple: you have to eat the red dot to make the green snake grow as much as possible.
